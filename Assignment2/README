All following informations are also written on my liquid layout-homepage.

There are two Designs: On the first one (when the windows has its full size, 1680x1050), all three boxes are next to each other.
The second one is for the resolution 1024x768. There are two boxes on the top and one below.

My Javascript checks the size everytime when the window is resized. Is the width below 1100 and the height below 800,
it changes to the "small" design, otherwise it uses the "big" design.

There is another function - just for fun :) - where you can change the colors of the Text by clicking on the "change style" link below. 



Why use liquid layout?

There are several reasons to use liquid layout:
First it uses the space provided by the Browser efficiently. It could happen that the space would be empty if your resolution is small,
we can avoid that by using liquid layout.

The designer won't have to worry about the size of the Web browser or screen resolution, he can use liquid layouts.
It doesn't matter WHO is viewing the page, the designer is able to get as much information as possible across even a small screen.

It's always easier to scroll down than to scroll left and right if you want to read something, that's where liquid layouts come in handy.
